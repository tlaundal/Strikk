 Strikk
========

Strikk is an annotation library for Bukkit plugins. The goal is to relieve plugins authors of the burden of writing
`plugin.yml` files, and make it easy to define Plugins, Permissions and Commands in code.

The library is based on annotation processing, and will also contain some convenience functions, like automatic
registration of commands and listeners.
